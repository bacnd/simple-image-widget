Simple Image Widget is what the name implies -- the easiest way to add images to sidebars in WordPress.

Despite its simplicity, Simple Image Widget is built with extensibility in mind, making it super easy to spin off new image-based widgets, or customize the widget output using the available template hierarchy.

## Installation

Simple Image Widget is available in the [WordPress plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-image-widget/), so it can be installed from your admin panel like most other plugins.
